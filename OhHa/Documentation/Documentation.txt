Subject: Minesweeper
A one-player-game where you try to find all the mines without denotating any of them. The nxm-large gameboard 
is filled with sqaures, which are ordered in n rows and m columns. Under some squares mines are hidden and by 
help of the given numbers on the open squares you are supposed to mark the mines. The faster the mines are found, 
the better it is. The level on the game depends on how big the gameboard is and how many mines that are hidden.
