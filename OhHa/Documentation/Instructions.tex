\section{Goal}

To find all the mines as fast as possible.

\section{How to play}

\subsection{Open the game}

To get the program to the computer, download Minesweeper.zip from Minesweeper. It contains the .jar -file, which starts the program.

\subsection{Left click}

Opens a button: \\
- If it is empty, it will open all the other empty squares around the pressed button \\
- If it is a number, it will show how many mines that are placed around the specific button \\
- If it is a mine, the game is lost \\

\subsection{Right click} 

Marks a button with a flag, assuming there's a mine hidden there: \\
- If a mine is already marked with a flag, the flag will be removed from the button \\
- When a button is marked with a flag, the button cannot be opened \\

\subsection{Timekeeping}

The time starts running when the first button is pressed and stops when the game is either lost or won.

\subsection{How to win}

When all the mines are marked with flags and the other buttons are opened, the game is won. Then it will pop a 
window showing the result (e.g. the time in seconds), and asking the player to enter his/her name if the time is good 
enough to enter the highscore list.
